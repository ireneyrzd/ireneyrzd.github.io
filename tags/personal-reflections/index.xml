      <description>The novel, Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly, particularily captured my attention when I saw the title. In middle school, I had watched a film about how these African American women were the brain and computers behind the construction of NASA’s spacecrafts. It really captivated me how during WWII, a time of bloodshed and violence, they were able to use their mathematical skills and intelligence, to make one calculation at a time, though seemingly small, but combined, they made a significant progress in America’s discovery of outerspace, gender, and racial equality.</description>

      <description>My favorite holiday is:
Halloween!!
You can reflect on what was your favorite character in the past year Share bondings with friends as you discuss whether you want to make a group costume together and make plans for trick or treat A demonstration of school spirit during our annual parade showcasing our costume around campus During October leading up to Halloween, I can use the promise of taking him trick-or-treating as a bribe to my little brother to listen to me.</description>
