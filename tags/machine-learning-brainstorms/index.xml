      <description>Why Music Dataset? Music Dataset is an free, public online platform that hopes to solve the subjecivity in music by collecting response of abstract components in classical music from a variety of audience. It seeks to take advantage the online setting where people from all over the world can be easily connected through one projects. The viewers are asked to place descriptive tags onto music according to the unique response that the particular repotoires evokes in them.</description>

      <description>If you look at my other post (SRA Experience Recap 7/26), the current music generation models can be improved to become more customizable if a dataset with specific labels are created. Then, when a user prompts for a certain characteristic as input, only songs with corresponding tags would be fed into the training model, and the output result would follow the desire of the user.
Possible Labels to the MusicNet datasets  Composer Musical period (eg.</description>

      <description>In my 2021 summer going from sophomore to junior year, I was honored to be selected to be part of a highly selective summer research program: Summer Research Academies at UC Santa Barbara. The program has an overall acceptance rate of 18.9% and I was one of five girls in a group of 26 students enrolled in Track 9 Machine Intelligence: An Introduction to Optimization and Machine learning.
During the four week program, me along with my group of two other students were challenged to create a machine learning project.</description>

      <description>My favorite hobbies revolve around music as I enjoy playing the piano, the flute, and dancing. Additionally, I enjoy building both tangible and virtual projects. In the future, I would like to major in Computer Science, and currently am most appealed in the field of machine learning. Thus, I would like to combine my interests to create a machine learning project that would benefit music education.
Below are some of my project brainstorm ideas as well as how they can fulfill the needs for people from a variety of backgrounds.</description>
