      <description>If you look at my other post (SRA Experience Recap 7/26), the current music generation models can be improved to become more customizable if a dataset with specific labels are created. Then, when a user prompts for a certain characteristic as input, only songs with corresponding tags would be fed into the training model, and the output result would follow the desire of the user.
Possible Labels to the MusicNet datasets  Composer Musical period (eg.</description>

      <description>In my 2021 summer going from sophomore to junior year, I was honored to be selected to be part of a highly selective summer research program: Summer Research Academies at UC Santa Barbara. The program has an overall acceptance rate of 18.9% and I was one of five girls in a group of 26 students enrolled in Track 9 Machine Intelligence: An Introduction to Optimization and Machine learning.
During the four week program, me along with my group of two other students were challenged to create a machine learning project.</description>

      <description>What is Hugo? Hugo provides sample website templates, which include intructions in simple English language in how to fill in different sections. Once that is complete, Hugo will automatically generate the html code for the website using the template. The website can then be published using a url domain such as one from github.

      <description>My favorite hobbies revolve around music as I enjoy playing the piano, the flute, and dancing. Additionally, I enjoy building both tangible and virtual projects. In the future, I would like to major in Computer Science, and currently am most appealed in the field of machine learning. Thus, I would like to combine my interests to create a machine learning project that would benefit music education.
Below are some of my project brainstorm ideas as well as how they can fulfill the needs for people from a variety of backgrounds.</description>

      <description>In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “All men are created equal”. However, history contradicts this as the fight for equality between genders and between races has not yet ended even as of now in the twenty-first century. Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly was set in the 1960s, when the civil rights movement was prominent as people protested unfair laws and when the feminist movement had people fighting for greater personal freedom.</description>
