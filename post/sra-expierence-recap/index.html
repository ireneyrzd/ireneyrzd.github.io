						<p>In my 2021 summer going from sophomore to junior year, I was honored to be selected to be part of a highly selective summer research program: Summer Research Academies at UC Santa Barbara. The program has an overall acceptance rate of 18.9% and I was one of five girls in a group of 26 students enrolled in Track 9 Machine Intelligence: An Introduction to Optimization and Machine learning.</p>
<p>During the four week program, me along with my group of two other students were challenged to create a machine learning project. Prompted by a common interest in music, we decided to code using Python, a machine learning model that can predict a sequence of tonal melody.</p>
<p>Below I have included a summary of our research and findings:</p>
<h4 id="currently-existing-technologies">Currently existing technologies:</h4>
<p>Google Magenta project utilizes the Transformer model as the neural network, where a stack of encoders are passed into a black box function and a stack of decoding sequence in the same number is outputted.</p>
<p>The Magenta Music Transformer focus on three categories: unconditional, continuation, and accompagnement. We decided to model our project unconditionally, as it is the only one that does not require a user input.</p>
<p>More can be read in my previous post (Music Generation Brainstorm 6/25)</p>
<h4 id="my-project---musics-generation-using-machine">My Project - <em>Musics Generation using Machine</em></h4>
<h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>
<p>Music is an important aspect of our daily life and exists in much of the media we digest, including cellular ringtones and alarms. It depends on many concrete and abstract factors, and since music involves expression of emotion, the complexity means that there has been a lack of studies done on generating music using machines. However, what computers are very good at, is doing mathematical and procedural calculations. So, we decided to focus on the concrete aspects of music, specifically the pitch and rhythm, and explore the possibility of these being generated through a machine learning algorithm.</p>
<h5 id="significance">Significance</h5>
<p>Music generation can be used for many recreational and commercial activities. This can include helping composers write songs, helping media industries save time and money with background audios, generate playlists, and even extending the works of deceased or retired composers. In addition to extending works it can also create songs with styles similar to those deceased or retired composers.</p>
<p>For our project, we would like to investigate how deep learning and artificial intelligence can be used to generate simple musical melodies.</p>
<h5 id="methodology">Methodology</h5>
<p>Our model is made up of 2 LSTM and dropout layers, with one dense layer at the end.  The input to the model is a 10-element long sequence of notes, and the output shape is the number of possible note values the model can guess, also known as the vocabulary. The input is a 10 x 1 vector and the output is a 1x<em>vocab length</em> vector.</p>
<p>We selected the MAESTRO music dataset for our work, a fairly common dataset used for music machine learning projects, including Google&rsquo;s Magenta.</p>
<p>We extracted the MIDI files from the dataset, remove all possible errors, and converted them into ABC files.  Next, we vectorized our data for the model, splitted away certain unwanted characters that we donâ€™t want to feed into the model. The text elements then converted into a number, creating a vocabulary.</p>
<p>The model requires an input of a normalized sequence with a length of ten, and an output of length vocabulary, the process is repeated for the length of the melodic line and each respective y value is one-hot encoded.  Our result model can utilize the softmax activation function to predict each new element. At the end, the output array is converted to its corresponding vocabulary term and back into a midi file.</p>

</figure>

<h5 id="result">Result</h5>
<p>We trained our results with a vocabulary length of 324 elements and a data size of about 1000 x and y pairs. We found that the best melody is generated with a loss of 0.1 and accuracy of 70% trained at 250 epochs and a batch size of 128.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Our LSTM model was successful at generating musical melodies.  The model was able to produce sequences of tonal notes nicely similar to the process of a text generation model creating a valid sequence of words.</p>
<h4 id="future-area-of-improvements">Future Area of improvements</h4>
<p>Future research can improve upon this study by training the model on different difficulties, genres, and speeds of music to create more customizable outputs. If we can filter the input and add descriptive tags to the repertoires fed into the training model, then the generated output would match the desired qualities inputted by the user. I believe the next step would be to create such a dataset with labels such as emotion, speed, difficulty, and other qualities we would like to see as customizable functions in a music generation model. ***</p>
<p>In addition, more LSTM layers can be added in order to detect more sophisticated melodic patterns.  Additional techniques such as reinforcement learning can be used to improve the model as well.</p>
