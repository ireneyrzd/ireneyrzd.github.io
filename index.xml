      <description>My favorite hobbies revolve around music as I enjoy playing the piano, the flute, and dancing. Additionally, I enjoy building both tangible and virtual projects. In the future, I would like to major in Computer Science, and currently am most appealed in the field of machine learning. Thus, I would like to combine my interests to create a machine learning project that would benefit music education.
Below are some of my project brainstorm ideas as well as how they can fulfill the needs for people from a variety of backgrounds.</description>

      <description>In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “All men are created equal”. However, history contradicts this as the fight for equality between genders and between races has not yet ended even as of now in the twenty-first century. Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly was set in the 1960s, when the civil rights movement was prominent as people protested unfair laws and when the feminist movement had people fighting for greater personal freedom.</description>
